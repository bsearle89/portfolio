        		I went through my school and university days with no strong notion of what I wanted to do. I just thought I’d figure it out as I went along and my choice would become clear after I graduated. After a four year undergraduate degree and a 1 year postgraduate course I still had no idea what to do. I took a job in an Ecommerce department for an online retailer and quickly learned that the job wasn’t for me. I wasn’t really interested in many aspects of my role with the exception of making changes to the frontend of the website using HTML. I did some soul searching and decided that creating and improving websites for a living would be a very different and exciting career, so I left my job, found part time work and now, signed up for a course and now, here I am!

        		I am an athlete and am very passionate about my sport. I have noticed in the past that finding information online about sports clubs, national governing bodies and event information is often difficult as there a lot of websites in the sporting world that drastically need an overhaul. Furthermore, I believe there is a gap in the market for apps related to specific sports. If I could pick anything to work on, I would love to help the world of club sport improve its presence and functionality online.

        		This is a tricky question to answer at the moment, considering my design process so far has been to follow instructions on a computer screen. I believe in the future that I will list all the information and functionality that will be needed for a project. I would then make a simple design for the layout of the website. After that I would put the HTML together and style it with the CSS. From there I would add the functionality and tweak the design before inviting feedback from friends and colleagues.
