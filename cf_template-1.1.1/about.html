						<h3>More About Me...</h3>
						<p>For many years, I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. I was always told the best thing I could do would be to go to University and get a degree, "that'll open some doors for you and you'll have a degree for the rest of your life!". So I went to University and studied Philosophy and Theology in Glasgow. After that I decided to do a postgraduate course in Sports Management. I spent five years studying and took on a variety of voluntary projects in an attempt to expand my horizons and figure out what my career should be. After all the studying and soul searching I still didn't have a feel for what I wanted to be doing, so I took a job with a retail chain in their Ecommerce department. I liked the people I worked with but I knew pretty soon into the job that retail wasn't for me. I didn't feel the drive to generate business for the benefit of a big company. I did find, however, that I was fascinated by the inner workings of the website. The trouble was, the technical aspects of website maintenance and development were a very small part of my job, so I made a decision. I decided to leave my job, find part time work and try my hand at Web Development. I am still new to the world of Web Development, but my experience in trampoline gymnastics has provided me with an invaluable life lesson. No one ever got good at anything without hours and hours of practice! So here I am, learning and practicing, so that one day, maybe I can become a successful, freelance Web Developer.</p>
